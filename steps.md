I want to build a trivia-like game with Flask. Each page should have a question and an expected answer. The person then has a slider to predict the probability they believe GPT4 will answer the question with the expected answer. There should be a submit button on each page. When they click submit, it should show whether or not GPT-4 could actually answer the question (and give the answer the model gave as a reference). Then there should be a "Next Question" button.


I want the following pages
- GET /home: introduce the contest. Explain the rules. Have a single link to start with the first question. Create a session variable for this person.
- GET /question?id=[uuid]: show question [uuid] as described above
- POST /score: given POST parameters id=[uuid] session=[uuid] and guess=[float from 0 to 1]
* First add this guess to the list of all guesses for that question
* Then compute the person's log loss to return
* Finally say how well this is compared to everyone else on that question.


You will need global variables for
- scores: a dictionary mapping question UUID to a list of predictions as floats. {question1: [.5, .1, .9]}
- entries: a dictionary mapping user UUIDs to a dictionary of question UUIDs to floats. So for example {person1: {question1: .5, question2: .8}}
- questions: a list of tuples of Q/A pairs: [("What is 1+1?", "2")...]
- answers: a list of integers for whether or not the model gets it right [0, 1, 0 ...]

User
Can you give me the HTML files needed?

User
I want score to return JSON output, and the question page to fetch the JSON output (no libraries please), parse it, and render the output below the question, and then draw a new next question button. I don't need a score.html any more.

User
Please continue

User
Great. Now I want you to rewrite score to:
- Simplify the code by putting an early abort return if there's no session instead of indenting it all.
- Returning not just a better/worse comparison but a histogram of how well the person did compared to everyone else drawn as a jpeg with matplotlib.
Also note, you'll need to handle multiple requests to the /score endpoint concurrently, as the current implementation would overwrite the histogram.jpg file. Consider creating a unique filename for each histogram, perhaps by using the user's session ID and/or a timestamp.

User
Can you make it not have a race condition for the file saving with some io buffer?


User
Adjust the HTML too please

In the updated question.html, the fetchScore function now calls a separate fetchHistogram function to retrieve the histogram image once it's done with processing the JSON response. The fetchHistogram function retrieves the histogram image as a blob and then creates an image tag with the blob as its source.


You'll also need to adjust your Flask application to accommodate this. Split the current /score route into two routes: /score for returning the JSON data, and /score/histogram for returning the image.


Here is an example of how the updated Flask application could look like:

    qid = request.form.get('id', type=int)
    guess = request.form.get('guess', type=float)
    
    if qid is None or guess is None:

    # Add to the list of all guesses for that question
    scores.setdefault(qid, []).append(guess)
    
    # Add to the person's guesses
    entries.setdefault(user_id, {})[qid] = guess

    # Compute the person's log loss

user_log_loss = log_loss([answers[qid]], [guess], labels=[0, 1])


# Compare with others
other_scores = scores[qid]
other_log_losses = [log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for score in other_scores]

comparison = 'better' if user_log_loss &lt; np.mean(other_log_losses) else 'worse'

return jsonify({'user_log_loss': user_log_loss, 'comparison': comparison})

@app.route('/score/histogram', methods=['POST'])
def score_histogram():
# Ensure there is a valid session
user_id = session.get('id')

    return redirect(url_for('home'))

Remember on the question page I want a "next question" button to show up after the graph comes back. Don't let the user also submit the same question multiple times. Check this in the background not the foreground.

Assistant
To prevent users from submitting the same question multiple times, you can modify your Flask routes to check whether a user has already submitted a guess for a particular question before processing the submission.


You can add this check in both /score and /score/histogram routes:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12

@app.route('/score', methods=['POST'])
def score():
    # Ensure there is a valid session
    user_id = session.get('id')
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    qid = request.form.get('id', type=int)
    guess = request.form.get('guess', type=float)

    if qid is None or guess is None:
        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    # Check if user has already answered this question
    if qid in entries.setdefault(user_id, {}):
        return jsonify({'error': 'You have already submitted an answer for this question.'})
    # ...

The same check can be added to /score/histogram route. If the user has already answered the question, the server responds with an error message.


In your JavaScript, check for this error message and display it to the user:

function fetchScore() {

    if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE &amp;&amp; this.status === 200) {
        var result = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        if (result.error) {
            alert(result.error);
            return;

            img.src = URL.createObjectURL(this.response);
            document.body.appendChild(img);
            createNextButton();
        } else {
            var reader = new FileReader();
            reader.onload = function() {
                var result = JSON.parse(reader.result);
                if (result.error) {
                    alert(result.error);
                }
            };
            reader.readAsText(this.response);
        }
    };
    // ...
}

function createNextButton() {
    var btn = document.createElement("button");
    btn.textContent = "Next Question";
    btn.onclick = function() {
        window.location.href = '/question?id=' + (parseInt(document.getElementById("id").value) + 1);
    };
    document.body.appendChild(btn);
}

In the updated JavaScript, fetchScore and fetchHistogram check if the server response contains an error message, and if so, they display this message to the user.


The fetchHistogram function calls a new createNextButton function after the histogram image is displayed. This function creates a "Next Question" button, which redirects the user to the next question when clicked. The ID of the next question is assumed to be the current question's ID incremented by 1.

User
Now when you submit, also grey out the previous question area. Also change the format of the question to have:


Question: Answer:
[ the question] [the answer]


Side by side like this. I also want the slider to be the full width of the page, and there to be a text number box that shows your current probability.

        </form>
    </div>
    <div id="score"></div>
</body>
</html>

I've added some CSS rules to make the slider full width and display the question and answer side by side. The updateGuessValue function is triggered when the slider is moved, and it updates the number box with the current value of the slider.


The disabled-content class is added to the content when the score is being fetched, to disable user interaction and visually indicate that it's been submitted.


Here are the corresponding JavaScript changes:

    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

}

function fetchHistogram() {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // Rest of your code here...
}

function updateGuessValue(val) {
    document.getElementById("guess-output").value = val;
}

Please note that this code assumes that the id value for the questions increases by one for each subsequent question. In practice, you would likely use a unique identifier (e.g. UUID) for each question, in which case you would need a different way to determine the id for the "Next Question" button.

User
I want the numbers to show up in an input box after the "your guess" text that will also edit the slider and vice versa. Center the submit button and make it bigger. Center the question and answer text. Each should take 1/2 of the space.

In this revision, I've placed the range and number inputs in a div to keep them together. The onchange event on the number input updates the slider when the number is manually changed. The Submit button is also made larger and centered by adding CSS styles.

}

function updateGuessValue(val) {
    document.getElementById("guess-output").value = val;
}

function updateSliderValue(val) {
    document.getElementById("guess").value = val;
}

Now, changing the number in the input box will update the position of the slider, and moving the slider will update the number in the input box.

Also make the next page button big, and make it centered

        #next-button {
            display: block;
            width: 50%;
            margin: 20px auto;
            padding: 10px;
            font-size: 1.2em;
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
    <!-- The rest of your script here... -->

<body>
    <div id="content">
        <!-- Your existing HTML content... -->
    </div>
    <div id="score"></div>

Now, in your JavaScript, assign the CSS ID next-button to your "Next Question" button:

1

function createNextButton() {
    var btn = document.createElement("button");
    btn.id = "next-button";
    btn.textContent = "Next Question";
    btn.onclick = function() {
        window.location.href = '/question?id=' + (parseInt(document.getElementById("id").value) + 1);
    };
    document.body.appendChild(btn);
}

This will style the "Next Question" button to be larger, centered, and placed a bit further from the image. The width is set to 50% of the parent container, and margin: auto is used to center the button. The font size, padding, and text alignment are also adjusted for better appearance.

If you have already answered, you should not alert(), but still show the graph, just not register the new score. and say you've already answered this question and that this won't update your score.

Assistant
Sure, you can modify your Flask route and the JavaScript code to display the graph and a message instead of an alert when a user tries to submit an answer to a question they've already answered.


Firstly, modify the Flask route /score to return the score and the histogram even if the question has already been answered:

@app.route('/score', methods=['POST'])
def score():
    # Ensure there is a valid session
    user_id = session.get('id')
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    qid = request.form.get('id', type=int)
    guess = request.form.get('guess', type=float)

    if qid is None or guess is None:
        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    # If the user has already answered the question, add a flag to the response
    already_answered = qid in entries.setdefault(user_id, {})

    if not already_answered:
        entries[user_id][qid] = guess
        scores.setdefault(qid, []).append(guess)

    # ...
    # The rest of your code to compute the score and return the response
    # ...

    return jsonify({'score': score, 'comparison': comparison, 'already_answered': already_answered})

Now, the server will include a flag in the JSON response to indicate whether the user has already answered the question.


Next, modify your JavaScript function fetchScore() to handle this flag:

function fetchScore() {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // ...

    if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE &amp;&amp; this.status === 200) {
        var result = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        if (result.error) {
            alert(result.error);
            return;
        }

        var scoreDiv = document.getElementById("score");
        scoreDiv.textContent = 'Your score: ' + result.score.toFixed(2) + '. ' +
            'This is ' + result.comparison + ' than the average score.';

        if (result.already_answered) {
            scoreDiv.textContent += ' You have already answered this question. This score will not update your record.';
        }

        fetchHistogram();
    }
    // ...
}

With these changes, when a user attempts to answer a question they've already answered, they will still see the graph and their score, and a message will be displayed indicating that their score for this question won't be updated.

User
Make the page also show what the GPT-4 output was from a global variable actual_text when the user hits submit. Make it print it out word-by-word like a typewriter effect at about 5 words per second. Only then does it
1. show you got it right or wrong (after 1 second delay)
2. show your loss and histogram (after 1 more second delay)

Assistant
To achieve this effect, we can introduce some changes in the JavaScript on your question.html page. We need to use setInterval function to print out the text word by word, and setTimeout to delay the display of the right/wrong message and the loss/histogram.


First, let's modify the fetchScore function to get the GPT-4 output and start the "typewriter" effect:

function fetchScore() {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // ...

    if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE &amp;&amp; this.status === 200) {
        var result = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        if (result.error) {
            alert(result.error);
            return;
        }

        // Get the GPT-4 output and start the typewriter effect
        var gptOutput = result.gpt_output;
        var words = gptOutput.split(' ');
        var outputDiv = document.getElementById("gpt-output");
        var wordIndex = 0;

        var typewriterInterval = setInterval(function() {
            outputDiv.textContent += words[wordIndex] + ' ';
            wordIndex++;

            if (wordIndex >= words.length) {
                clearInterval(typewriterInterval);

                // After the GPT-4 output is fully displayed, show the right/wrong message after a delay
                setTimeout(function() {
                    // Assume the variable `correct` is returned in the response to indicate if the guess is correct or not
                    outputDiv.textContent += result.correct ? 'You got it right!' : 'You got it wrong.';
                    
                    // After the right/wrong message, show the loss and histogram after another delay
                    setTimeout(function() {
                        var scoreDiv = document.getElementById("score");
                        scoreDiv.textContent = 'Your score: ' + result.score.toFixed(2) + '. ' +
                            'This is ' + result.comparison + ' than the average score.';

                        if (result.already_answered) {
                            scoreDiv.textContent += ' You have already answered this question. This score will not update your record.';
                        }

                        fetchHistogram();
                    }, 1000);
                }, 1000);
            }
        }, 200);  // 200ms delay between each word, which is about 5 words per second
    }
}

Please add an HTML element with the id "gpt-output" to your HTML file where you'd like the GPT-4 output to be displayed:

1
<div id="gpt-output"></div>

Remember to update your Flask route /score to include the GPT-4 output and whether the guess is correct in the JSON response:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
@app.route('/score', methods=['POST'])
def score():
    # ...
    # Compute the score and check the guess...
    # ...

    return jsonify({
        'score': score,
        'comparison': comparison,
        'already_answered': already_answered,
        'gpt_output': actual_text[qid],  # assuming you have a global variable `actual_text` that stores the GPT-4 output
        'correct': int(guess == answers[qid])  # convert to int so it can be JSON serialized
    })

User
Can you write some actual_text for these questions

Assistant
Sure, for this example, we can manually create some example actual_text as responses from GPT-4. Keep in mind that GPT-4 doesn't necessarily output a simple, straightforward response to a question as it depends on the model's settings and the context provided.


Let's assume you have these questions and expected answers:

1
2
3
4
5
questions = [("What is the capital of France?", "Paris"),
             ("Who wrote the novel '1984'?", "George Orwell"),
             ("What is the symbol for gold in the periodic table?", "Au")]

answers = [1, 1, 1]  # Assume that GPT-4 got all the answers correct

For these questions, GPT-4's responses could look like this:

1
2
3
actual_text = ["The capital of France is Paris.", 
               "The novel '1984' was written by George Orwell.", 
               "In the periodic table, the symbol for gold is Au."]

You can change actual_text to be whatever text you want to be printed out when the user submits their answer. It's set to match the answers here, but it would usually be the text generated by the model.

User
I moved the javascript to question.js file how do I edit the main.py

Assistant
To serve static files such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, Flask uses a folder named static by default. This folder should be located in the same directory as the script where you created the Flask application instance.


You need to move your question.js into a directory named static in your project:

1
2
3
4
5
6
    /static
        /question.js
    /templates
        /question.html
        /home.html
    /main.py

Then, in your question.html, you need to use the url_for function to include the JavaScript file:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Trivia Game</title>
    <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='question.js') }}"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content... -->
</body>
</html>

This should work because Flask automatically serves files in the static directory at the /static endpoint, and url_for('static', filename='question.js') will generate the URL to access question.js.


Note: Ensure to wrap url_for with double braces, {{ and }}, because this is Jinja2 syntax to evaluate expressions in the template. Jinja2 is the default templating engine used by Flask.


After moving question.js into the static directory and changing your question.html to include the script using url_for, the JavaScript code should be properly loaded when you access the question page.

User
I no longer want a delay between the chart and you got it right/wrong. But please clearly mark the generated text as output by putting it in a light grey box. Also say "you guessed correctly/incorrectly that GPT-4 could solve the question."

Assistant
Sure, you can achieve that by modifying your JavaScript and adding some CSS styles to your question.html. Let's start with the JavaScript modifications:

function fetchScore() {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // ...

    if (this.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE &amp;&amp; this.status === 200) {
        var result = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        if (result.error) {
            alert(result.error);
            return;
        }

        // Get the GPT-4 output and start the typewriter effect
        var gptOutput = result.gpt_output;
        var words = gptOutput.split(' ');
        var outputDiv = document.getElementById("gpt-output");
        var wordIndex = 0;

        var typewriterInterval = setInterval(function() {
            outputDiv.textContent += words[wordIndex] + ' ';
            wordIndex++;

            if (wordIndex >= words.length) {
                clearInterval(typewriterInterval);

                // After the GPT-4 output is fully displayed, show the right/wrong message
                outputDiv.textContent += result.correct ? ' You guessed correctly that GPT-4 could solve the question.' : ' You guessed incorrectly that GPT-4 could solve the question.';

                // Then, show the loss and histogram
                var scoreDiv = document.getElementById("score");
                scoreDiv.textContent = 'Your score: ' + result.score.toFixed(2) + '. ' +
                    'This is ' + result.comparison + ' than the average score.';

                if (result.already_answered) {
                    scoreDiv.textContent += ' You have already answered this question. This score will not update your record.';
                }

                fetchHistogram();
            }
        }, 200);  // 200ms delay between each word, which is about 5 words per second
    }
}

Now, let's add some CSS to your question.html to put the GPT-4 output in a light grey box:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14

23
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Trivia Game</title>
    <style>
        /* Your existing styles... */
        #gpt-output {
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
            border-radius: 4px;
            padding: 10px;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
    </style>
    <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='question.js') }}"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="content">
        <!-- Your existing HTML content... -->
    </div>
    <div id="gpt-output"></div>
    <div id="score"></div>
</body>
</html>

With these changes, the GPT-4 output will be displayed in a light grey box, and the right/wrong message and loss/histogram will be displayed immediately after the GPT-4 output without any delay. The right/wrong message will also be more detailed, stating whether the user guessed correctly or incorrectly that GPT-4 could solve the question.

User
I want the correct/incorrect guess not to appear in the gpt4 box. Also make the gpt box hidden to start

Assistant
Sure, you can place the result message outside the GPT-4 box by introducing a new div for the result message. We can also start with the GPT-4 output box hidden and show it when we start the typewriter effect.

            background-color: #f0f0f0;
            border-radius: 4px;
            padding: 10px;

        var result = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        if (result.error) {
            alert(result.error);
            return;
        }

        // Get the GPT-4 output and start the typewriter effect
        var gptOutput = result.gpt_output;
        var words = gptOutput.split(' ');
        var outputDiv = document.getElementById("gpt-output");
        outputDiv.style.display = 'block';  // Show the GPT-4 output box
        var wordIndex = 0;

        var typewriterInterval = setInterval(function() {
            outputDiv.textContent += words[wordIndex] + ' ';
            wordIndex++;

            if (wordIndex >= words.length) {
                clearInterval(typewriterInterval);

                // After the GPT-4 output is fully displayed, show the right/wrong message in the result div
                var resultDiv = document.getElementById("result");
                resultDiv.textContent = result.correct ? 'You guessed correctly that GPT-4 could solve the question.' : 'You guessed incorrectly that GPT-4 could solve the question.';

                // Then, show the loss and histogram
                var scoreDiv = document.getElementById("score");
                scoreDiv.textContent = 'Your score: ' + result.score.toFixed(2) + '. ' +
                    'This is ' + result.comparison + ' than the average score.';

                if (result.already_answered) {
                    scoreDiv.textContent += ' You have already answered this question. This score will not update your record.';
                }

                fetchHistogram();
            }
        }, 200);  // 200ms delay between each word, which is about 5 words per second
    }
}

Now, the GPT-4 output box will be hidden initially, then shown when the GPT-4 output starts to be displayed. The result message (whether the user guessed correctly or not) will appear outside the GPT-4 output box.

User
When you reach the last question, the next question button should take you to /final and that page should show you how well you did on average. Compare your log-loss to the average log-loss of every user. Also draw a plot showing your log loss and everyone elses with matplotlib like you did last time. Here was your score histogram function:


@app.route('/score/histogram', methods=['POST'])
def score_histogram():
# Ensure there is a valid session

user_id = session.get('id')
if not user_id:
return redirect(url_for('home'))


qid = request.form.get('id', type=int)
guess = request.form.get('guess', type=float)

if qid is None or guess is None:
    return redirect(url_for('home'))

other_scores = scores[qid]
other_log_losses = [log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for score in other_scores]
user_log_loss = log_loss([answers[qid]], [guess], labels=[0, 1])

# Draw a histogram using matplotlib and save it as jpeg in memory                                                                                                                                                                                
fig = Figure()
canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

ax.hist(other_log_losses, bins=30, alpha=0.5)
ax.axvline(user_log_loss, color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)
ax.set_title('Your score compared to others')
ax.set_xlabel('Log Loss')
ax.set_ylabel('Count')
ax.grid(True)

buf = BytesIO()
canvas.print_figure(buf, format='jpeg')
buf.seek(0)

return send_file(buf, mimetype='image/jpeg', as_attachment=False)

Now you should refactor it to have a draw_histogram and use this for score and final.

Assistant
Alright, let's start with creating a helper function draw_histogram() that takes the user's score and the scores of others and draws the histogram.


In the main.py file:

 1

 7

from flask import send_file
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
from io import BytesIO

def draw_histogram(user_score, other_scores):
    fig = Figure()
    canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

    ax.hist(other_scores, bins=30, alpha=0.5)
    ax.axvline(user_score, color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)
    ax.set_title('Your score compared to others')
    ax.set_xlabel('Log Loss')
    ax.set_ylabel('Count')
    ax.grid(True)

    buf = BytesIO()
    canvas.print_figure(buf, format='jpeg')
    buf.seek(0)

    return buf

Then, in both your /score/histogram and /final routes, you can use this function to draw the histogram and return it as a JPEG file:

    all_avg_log_loss = sum(all_scores) / len(all_scores)

    buf = draw_histogram(user_avg_log_loss, all_avg_log_loss)

    return send_file(buf, mimetype='image/jpeg', as_attachment=False)

The final_page() route calculates the average log loss for the user and all users, then uses draw_histogram() to draw a histogram comparing these two averages. The histogram is then returned as a JPEG file. Note that you need to take care to avoid division by zero if there are no scores yet.

User
I need a final page html that we should be sending the user to if there is no next question.

Assistant
Sure, let's create a new HTML file called final.html for the final page. This page will display a message to the user, as well as the user's average log loss compared to all other users, and a histogram.

User
I get an error TypeError: Failed to execute 'createObjectURL' on 'URL': Overload

Assistant
The error message you're seeing typically occurs when trying to create an Object URL from an incorrect type.


The fetch API's response.blob() method returns a promise that resolves with a Blob, so we need to wait for this promise to resolve before passing the blob to URL.createObjectURL().


Please change your fetch('/final/histogram') fetch call in final.html to:

1
2
3
4
5
6
fetch('/final/histogram')
    .then(response => response.blob())
    .then(blob => {
        var chart = document.getElementById('chart');
        chart.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    });

This code first waits for response.blob() to resolve into a Blob, then passes the Blob to URL.createObjectURL() to create a URL for the image element's src attribute.

User
In final you computed the mean score, not the log loss, can you do that

Assistant
I apologize for the confusion earlier. To compute the average log loss for a user and for all users, we first need to calculate the individual log loss for each guess, and then compute the average of these values. Here's how we can modify the /final/score route:

    all_entries = {user: entries for user, entries in entries.items() if user != user_id}

    if not user_entries or not all_entries:
        return jsonify(error='No scores found')

    user_log_losses = [log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for qid, score in user_entries.items()]
    all_log_losses = [log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for user_entries in all_entries.values() for qid, score in user_entries.items()]

    user_avg_log_loss = sum(user_log_losses) / len(user_log_losses)
    all_avg_log_loss = sum(all_log_losses) / len(all_log_losses)

    return jsonify(user_avg_log_loss=user_avg_log_loss, all_avg_log_loss=all_avg_log_loss)

In the /final/histogram route, we need to adjust the computation accordingly:

        return jsonify(error='No session found')

    user_entries = entries.get(user_id, {})

    user_log_losses = [log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for qid, score in user_entries.items()]
    all_log_losses = [log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for user_entries in all_entries.values() for qid, score in user_entries.items()]

    user_avg_log_loss = sum(user_log_losses) / len(user_log_losses)
    all_avg_log_loss = sum(all_log_losses) / len(all_log_losses)

    buf = draw_histogram(user_avg_log_loss, all_avg_log_loss)

    return send_file(buf, mimetype='image/jpeg', as_attachment=False)

In both routes, we're now calculating the log loss for each guess and then computing the average of these log losses.

    if not user_id:

    # Get the current question index for this user
    qid = session.get('qid', 0)
    if qid >= len(questions):
        # If there are no more questions, redirect to final page
        return redirect(url_for('final'))

    question, expected_answer = questions[qid]
    return render_template('question.html', id=qid, question=question, expected_answer=expected_answer)

In this case, if the current question index (qid) is equal to or greater than the total number of questions, the user is redirected to the /final page. Otherwise, the next question is shown.

User
Instead of drawing a perfect histogram can you draw a convolved plot that shows a smooted one? Add more or less smoothing depending on how many data points you have.

Assistant
Sure, we can achieve this by using a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot, which can provide a smoothed representation of a histogram. The scipy library provides functions to estimate a kernel density. Here's how to modify the draw_histogram function:

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import gaussian_kde

def draw_histogram(user_log_loss, other_log_losses):
    fig = Figure()
    canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

    # Calculate the kernel density estimation
    density = gaussian_kde(other_log_losses)

    # Generate x values
    xs = np.linspace(min(other_log_losses), max(other_log_losses), 200)

    # Adjust the bandwidth according to the number of data points
    density.covariance_factor = lambda : .25
    density._compute_covariance()

    # Draw the KDE plot
    ax.plot(xs, density(xs), alpha=0.5)

    # Draw a vertical line for user's score
    ax.axvline(user_log_loss, color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)

    ax.set_title('Your score compared to others')
    ax.set_xlabel('Log Loss')
    ax.set_ylabel('Density')
    ax.grid(True)

    buf = BytesIO()
    canvas.print_figure(buf, format='jpeg')
    buf.seek(0)

    return buf

This function will now generate a smooth curve that fits the distribution of the log loss scores. Note that we set the covariance factor of the density estimator to 0.25. This is arbitrary, and you might want to adjust this value to increase or decrease the amount of smoothing, depending on your dataset size.


The scipy gaussian_kde function automatically adjusts the bandwidth of the kernel according to the size of the dataset, but this default adjustment might not be ideal for all datasets, so it might be worth experimenting with different values for the covariance factor.


Remember to install scipy if you haven't done so already by using the following command:

1
pip install scipy

User
ValueError: dataset input should have multiple elements

Assistant
Apologies for the confusion, the error message is indicating that the gaussian_kde function requires an array-like input with multiple elements. This error can occur if the other_log_losses array has less than two elements.


To avoid this, you can add a check to only perform the KDE plot when other_log_losses has two or more elements. When it has less than two elements, you can simply return an empty plot.


Here's how you could adjust the draw_histogram function:

def draw_histogram(user_log_loss, other_log_losses):
    fig = Figure()
    canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

    # Check if we have enough data points for a KDE
    if len(other_log_losses) >= 2:
        # Calculate the kernel density estimation
        density = gaussian_kde(other_log_losses)

        # Generate x values
        xs = np.linspace(min(other_log_losses), max(other_log_losses), 200)

        # Adjust the bandwidth according to the number of data points
        density.covariance_factor = lambda : .25
        density._compute_covariance()

        # Draw the KDE plot
        ax.plot(xs, density(xs), alpha=0.5)
    else:
        # If we don't have enough data for a KDE, draw a placeholder line
        ax.axhline(0, color='b', alpha=0.5)

    # Draw a vertical line for user's score
    ax.axvline(user_log_loss, color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)

    ax.set_title('Your score compared to others')
    ax.set_xlabel('Log Loss')
    ax.set_ylabel('Density')
    ax.grid(True)

    buf = BytesIO()
    canvas.print_figure(buf, format='jpeg')
    buf.seek(0)

    return buf

In this adjusted code, we only calculate the KDE and draw the plot when there are two or more elements in other_log_losses. If there are not enough elements, we simply draw a horizontal line at y=0 as a placeholder. This way, we can avoid the ValueError you encountered.

User
Can you clip the slider to .01 to .99

Assistant
Sure, you can limit the range of the slider by adjusting the min and max attributes in your HTML file. Here's how you can modify the slider input in question.html:

1
2
3
4
<div>
    Your guess: <input type="number" id="sliderValue" value="0.50" min="0.01" max="0.99" step="0.01" oninput="slider.value=this.value" />
    <input type="range" id="slider" min="0.01" max="0.99" value="0.50" step="0.01" style="width: 100%" oninput="sliderValue.value=this.value" />
</div>

In this code, both the slider and the number input box will only allow values between 0.01 and 0.99. The step attribute is set to 0.01, meaning the slider and the number input box will increase or decrease in increments of 0.01.

User
Plotting: numpy.linalg.LinAlgError: singular matrix

Assistant
The error "singular matrix" is raised when a matrix doesn't have an inverse. In the context of the Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), this error usually means that the data provided has very little variance (i.e., all values are nearly identical).


You can handle this by checking if the standard deviation of other_log_losses is zero or very close to zero. If it is, you could create a placeholder plot as we did for the case with less than two data points. Here's how to modify the draw_histogram function:

    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

    # Check if we have enough data points for a KDE and if the standard deviation is not too close to zero
    if len(other_log_losses) >= 2 and np.std(other_log_losses) > 1e-6:
        try:
            # Calculate the kernel density estimation
            density = gaussian_kde(other_log_losses)

            # Generate x values
            xs = np.linspace(min(other_log_losses), max(other_log_losses), 200)

            # Adjust the bandwidth according to the number of data points
            density.covariance_factor = lambda : .25
            density._compute_covariance()

            # Draw the KDE plot
            ax.plot(xs, density(xs), alpha=0.5)
        except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
            # If the KDE computation fails, draw a placeholder line
            ax.axhline(0, color='b', alpha=0.5)
    else:
        # If we don't have enough data for a KDE, draw a placeholder line
        ax.axhline(0, color='b', alpha=0.5)

    # Draw a vertical line for user's score

    ax.grid(True)

    buf = BytesIO()
    canvas.print_figure(buf, format='jpeg')
    buf.seek(0)

    return buf

In this adjusted code, we check if the standard deviation of other_log_losses is larger than a very small number (1e-6) before trying to compute the KDE. If the standard deviation is too close to zero, or if the KDE computation fails, we draw a placeholder line at y=0.

User
Instead of saying how this compares to the average score can you say what percentile it is, using the KDE?

Assistant
Sure, we can use the KDE to compute the percentile rank of a given score. We can do this by integrating the density function from negative infinity to the given score, which will give us the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at that point. The CDF value is exactly the percentile rank we're looking for.


You'll need to use the integrate_box_1d method provided by the gaussian_kde object to do this. Here's how you can modify the draw_histogram and score functions to compute the percentile rank:

Let's make the input format better. Currently I have to edit the code directly to change questions, e.g.,


questions = [("What is the capital of France?", "Paris", "The first city listed must be Paris. Additional information is okay.", "commentary"),
("Who wrote the novel '1984'?", "George Orwell", "Just 'Orwell' would be correct. But 'Jeff Orwell' would be wrong.", "commentary"),
("What is the symbol for gold in the periodic table?", "Au", "", "commentary")]


answers = [1, 1, 1] # Assume that GPT-4 got all the answers correct

actual_text = ["The capital of France is Paris.",
"The novel '1984' was written by George Orwell.",
"In the periodic table, the symbol for gold is Au."]


I want to put this information all in a config file. Can you make a function to load it from one?

Assistant
Yes, you can certainly do that. A good format for your configuration file might be JSON, which is both human-readable and easy to work with in Python.


Here's what your config.json file might look like:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14

{
    "questions": [
        {
            "question": "What is the capital of France?",
            "answer": "Paris",
            "actual_text": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "commentary": "The first city listed must be Paris. Additional information is okay.",
            "correct": 1
        },
        {
            "question": "Who wrote the novel '1984'?",
            "answer": "George Orwell",
            "actual_text": "The novel '1984' was written by George Orwell.",
            "commentary": "Just 'Orwell' would be correct. But 'Jeff Orwell' would be wrong.",
            "correct": 1
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the symbol for gold in the periodic table?",
            "answer": "Au",
            "actual_text": "In the periodic table, the symbol for gold is Au.",
            "commentary": "",
            "correct": 1
        }
    ]
}

Then you can load this configuration into your application with a function like this:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12

import json

def load_config(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        config = json.load(f)
    
    questions = [(q['question'], q['answer'], q['actual_text'], q['commentary']) for q in config['questions']]
    answers = [q['correct'] for q in config['questions']]
    actual_text = [q['actual_text'] for q in config['questions']]

    return questions, answers, actual_text

# Load the configuration
questions, answers, actual_text = load_config('config.json')

In this function, we open the configuration file, parse it as JSON, and then extract the questions, answers, and actual_text into lists that your application can use. The load_config function is called at the start of your application to load the questions, answers, and actual text from the config.json file.

How do I fix this


      {{ if resolution is not None }}
      &lt;b&gt;Resolution Criteria:&lt;/b&gt; {{ resolution }}
      {{ endif }}
Assistant
The Jinja2 templating engine used in Flask expects control structures like if-else to be wrapped with {% %} and not {{ }}. The latter is used for variable substitution. So, you should change your code to:

1
2
3
{% if resolution is not None %}
<b>Resolution Criteria:</b> {{ resolution }}
{% endif %}

This tells the templating engine to only render the text between {% if %} and {% endif %} if the condition (in this case, resolution is not None) is true.

User
How about this? It says len not define.


        {% if len(resolution) &gt; 0 %}
Assistant
It seems like the len() function is not recognized by Jinja2. The Jinja2 template engine does not provide all Python functions directly. However, you can check if a string is empty just by treating it as a boolean, since an empty string is considered False in a boolean context.


Try changing your code to this:

1
2
3
{% if resolution %}
<b>Resolution Criteria:</b> {{ resolution }}
{% endif %}

This will show the "Resolution Criteria" line only if resolution is not an empty string.

The return value is now a dictionary containing all of the required data for the plot. You can send this dictionary directly to the client as a JSON response, and then use this data to draw the plot using Chart.js on the client side.


This approach will provide better performance and make the client-side rendering more interactive. Remember to convert numpy arrays into Python lists before serializing them into JSON. JSON doesn't support numpy data types.

User
Can you give me an example function in chart.js that assuming I pass as input userLogLoss, otherLogLossesXs, otherLogLossesYs will append a chart to the document body? Make it look like the matplotlib one.

Assistant
To draw a chart using Chart.js, you would first need to include the Chart.js library in your HTML file. You can include it directly from a CDN like this:

1
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>

Next, you need to create a canvas element in your HTML body where the chart will be drawn. We can assign an id to this canvas for easy referencing:

1
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>

Then in your JavaScript, you can create a new chart and append it to this canvas. The Chart.js library provides a lot of customization options, but for a basic line plot similar to your matplotlib one, you could do something like this:

                }
            }
        }
    });
}

This will create a line plot with a blue line for the KDE density of the other log losses and a red line indicating the user's log loss. Note that this is a simple example and you may want to customize the appearance to suit your needs.

User
Can you round the xs to show only 2 sigfigs? Also always make the plot start at 0 on the left. Also the line should be vertical not horizontal

Assistant
The line for the user's log loss should indeed be vertical, not horizontal. The 'data' field for that dataset should be set to null except at the point corresponding to the user's log loss. Also, to always start the plot at 0 and round the xs labels, we can modify the scales option. Here's the corrected code:

                    text: 'Your Loss Compared To Others'
                },
            },
            scales: {
                x: {
                    min: 0,  // Always start at 0
                    title: {
                        display: true,
                        text: 'Log Loss'
                    }
                },
                y: {
                    title: {
                        display: true,
                        text: 'Density'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    });
}

This will create a vertical line for the user's log loss and round the xs labels to 2 decimal places. It also ensures the x-axis starts at 0. Note that in this code the y-values for the user's line are taken from the density at the user's log loss. If you want a line that spans the whole y-axis, you could set userLogLossData to an array with two elements: [0, Math.max(...otherLogLossesYs)].

User
For the density can you make a smooth line instead of making a bunch of points? Also for the vertical line please use this


const verticalLinePlugin = {
getLinePosition: function (chart, pointIndex) {
const meta = chart.getDatasetMeta(0); // first dataset is used to discover X coordinate of a point
const data = meta.data;
return data[pointIndex]._model.x;
},
renderVerticalLine: function (chartInstance, pointIndex) {
const lineLeftOffset = this.getLinePosition(chartInstance, pointIndex);
const scale = chartInstance.scales['y-axis-0'];
const context = chartInstance.chart.ctx;


  // render vertical line
  context.beginPath();
  context.strokeStyle = '#ff0000';
  context.moveTo(lineLeftOffset, scale.top);
  context.lineTo(lineLeftOffset, scale.bottom);
  context.stroke();

  // write label
  context.fillStyle = "#ff0000";
  context.textAlign = 'center';
  context.fillText('MY TEXT', lineLeftOffset, (scale.bottom - scale.top) / 2 + scale.top);

},


afterDatasetsDraw: function (chart, easing) {
if (chart.config.lineAtIndex) {
chart.config.lineAtIndex.forEach(pointIndex => this.renderVerticalLine(chart, pointIndex));
}
}
};


Chart.plugins.register(verticalLinePlugin);

To get a smooth line instead of points, you can set the tension property to 0.4 in the dataset for the density. Also, I have included your code for drawing a vertical line using a plugin:

Chart.plugins.register(verticalLinePlugin);

// Create the chart
function createChart(userLogLoss, otherLogLossesXs, otherLogLossesYs) {
    var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
    
    // Find the index of the user's log loss in the xs array

                        text: 'Log Loss'
                    }

                }
            }
        }
    });
}

In this updated function, I removed the dataset for the user's line since the vertical line is now drawn by the plugin. I passed lineAtIndex: [userLogLossIndex] in the chart options to tell the plugin where to draw the vertical line. The tension property is set to 0.4 for the density dataset, giving it a smooth appearance.

User
I have lists otherLogLossesXs, otherLogLossesYs and I want to make them like [{x: 1, y: 12}]

Assistant
To transform your separate otherLogLossesXs and otherLogLossesYs arrays into a single array of {x, y} objects, you can use the map function:

1
2
3
let combined = otherLogLossesXs.map((x, i) => {
    return {x: x, y: otherLogLossesYs[i]};
});

In this piece of code, map goes through each element in the otherLogLossesXs array (with each element referred to as x), and for each element, it creates a new object with x set to the current element and y set to the corresponding element in the otherLogLossesYs array. The index of the current element is provided by i. The result is an array of objects, where each object has x and y properties corresponding to elements from otherLogLossesXs and otherLogLossesYs, respectively.

How do I add an iframe to a page with javascript that has contents loaded from a string?

Assistant
You can dynamically add an iframe to your page with JavaScript by using the createElement function, and then use srcdoc attribute to load contents from a string. Here's a simple example:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
let contentString = "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>";

let iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.srcdoc = contentString;
iframe.style.width = '100%';
iframe.style.height = '300px';

document.body.appendChild(iframe);

In this example, we first create a string contentString with HTML that we want to load into the iframe.


Next, we use document.createElement('iframe') to create a new iframe.


We then set the srcdoc attribute of the iframe to our contentString. This loads the content of the string into the iframe.


We also set the width and height of the iframe to desired values.


Finally, we append the iframe to the document's body using document.body.appendChild(iframe). You can replace document.body with any other valid parent element on the page as per your requirements.

User
The code I add to the iframe has a window.onload that doesn't fire. How do I make it trigger?

Assistant
If you're dynamically injecting HTML with JavaScript into an iframe and your window.onload event in your injected script isn't firing, it's likely because the window.onload event has already fired for the parent document before you've injected your iframe.


There are a few ways to handle this. One approach is to trigger the function directly instead of using window.onload. Here's an example:

<iframe id="myIframe"></iframe>

<script>
    var iframe = document.getElementById('myIframe');

    // Create the iframe's document
    var iframedoc = iframe.document;
    if (iframe.contentDocument)
        iframedoc = iframe.contentDocument;
    else if (iframe.contentWindow)
        iframedoc = iframe.contentWindow.document;

    // Write into the iframe
    iframedoc.open();
    iframedoc.writeln('\
        <!DOCTYPE html>\
        <html>\
        <body>\
        <script>\
        function myFunction() {\
            alert("Hello from the iframe!");\
        }\
        myFunction();\
        </script>\
        </body>\
        </html>'
    );
    iframedoc.close();
</script>

In this example, instead of using window.onload, we just call the function directly after declaring it (myFunction();). This will ensure that the function is called as soon as the script in the iframe is loaded.

User
With Chart.js how do I set the shaded area color to blue

Assistant
In Chart.js, you can use the backgroundColor property to set the fill color of the area under a line graph.


However, as of Chart.js version 3, the fill property defaults to false (meaning the area under the line will not be filled) so we need to manually set it to true or 'origin' to enable fill. The backgroundColor can accept various color formats, such as HEX, RGB, RGBA etc.


Here is an example:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        datasets: [{
            data: dataPoints, // your data points
            fill: 'origin',   // fill enabled and filling will occur against the y-axis zero level
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.5)', // blue color with some transparency
            borderColor: 'rgb(0, 123, 255)', // blue color for line
            ...
        }]
    },
    ...
});

In this example, we're using an RGBA color for the backgroundColor to create a semi-transparent blue color (which allows us to see where the graph overlaps). The borderColor is set to a solid blue color. Replace 'rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.5)' and 'rgb(0, 123, 255)' with the desired shades of blue for your chart.


Please replace dataPoints with your own data points and fill other necessary parts (denoted with ...) as per your needs.

User
I have a json file like this:


{
"questions": [
{
"question": "What is the capital of France?",
"answer": "Paris",
"actual_text": "The capital of France is Paris.",
"resolution": "",
"commentary": "This is a fairly easy question. Large language models, while not databases of facts, typically can answer questions like this correctly.<br/>Now let's move on to the next question...",
"correct": 1,
"header": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">GPT-4 Triva Trivia</h1><p>This game tests your ability to predict how well GPT-4 will perform at various types of questions, ranging from trivia knowledge, to coding interview questions, \
to medical or legal exam questions.</p> <p> Do you think GPT-4 will get the question below correct? <style>#myChart{display: none !important} #score{display: none !important}</style>"
},
]


Write a python program that reads this into a class-like thing so I can do data[0].header

Assistant
You can use the json module in Python to load your JSON file. You can then load these data into a namedtuple from the collections module to get the class-like behavior you want.


Here's an example:

import json
from collections import namedtuple

# Load the data from your file
with open('your_file.json', 'r') as f:
    raw_data = json.load(f)

# Define a class-like structure using namedtuple
Question = namedtuple("Question", ["question", "answer", "actual_text", "resolution", "commentary", "correct", "header"])

# Convert each dictionary to namedtuple instance and store it in a list
data = [Question(**item) for item in raw_data['questions']]

# Now you can access elements like so
print(data[0].header)

Make sure to replace 'your_file.json' with the actual path to your JSON file.


In this code, namedtuple is used to create a class Question with the attributes you provided. Then, we use a list comprehension to convert each dictionary in the list to an instance of Question, using **item to unpack the dictionary into keyword arguments.


This results in a list of Question instances, where you can access the attributes of each instance like you would with a class instance.


Keep in mind, namedtuple creates a class with immutable instances, so you won't be able to change the values of the attributes after they have been set. If you need to be able to modify the data, you might want to use a different data structure, like a simple class or dataclass (from Python 3.7 and onwards).

User
How do I make it so any missing ones are default to None

Assistant
The namedtuple doesn't support default values natively, but Python's dataclasses do. From Python 3.7 and onwards, you can use dataclasses to define a class with default values:

 1
 2
 3
 4

import json
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Question:
    question: str
    answer: str
    actual_text: str
    resolution: str = None
    commentary: str = None
    correct: int = None
    header: str = None

# Load the data from your file
with open('your_file.json', 'r') as f:
    raw_data = json.load(f)

# Convert each dictionary to namedtuple instance and store it in a list
data = [Question(**item) for item in raw_data['questions']]

# Now you can access elements like so
print(data[0].header)

The @dataclass decorator automatically adds special methods to the class, including a .__init__() method which uses the default values you've supplied when no value is provided for a given attribute.


In this code, all attributes except for "question", "answer", and "actual_text" will default to None if no value is provided. If you want all of them to default to None, you can simply add = None to the rest.


Make sure to replace 'your_file.json' with the actual path to your JSON file.

I have a variable pct that is the percentile each person is in. 0 is the best. Assign each person to a letter grade A+/A/A- etc down to F. Make this a variable called grade. In JavaScript. 20% of people should get a B. Only 3% A+. Make 10% fail.

  if (pct <= 0.03) {
    grade = "A+";
  } else if (pct <= 0.10) {
    grade = "A";
  } else if (pct <= 0.15) {
    grade = "A-";
  } else if (pct <= 0.35) {
    grade = "B+";
  } else if (pct <= 0.55) {
    grade = "B";
  } else if (pct <= 0.65) {
    grade = "B-";
  } else if (pct <= 0.75) {
    grade = "C+";
  } else if (pct <= 0.85) {
    grade = "C";
  } else if (pct <= 0.90) {
    grade = "C-";
  } else if (pct <= 0.95) {
    grade = "D";
  } else {
    grade = "F";
  }
  return grade;
}

You can use it like so:

1
2
3
let pct = 0.20;  // replace this with the actual percentile
let grade = assignGrade(pct);
console.log(grade);  // outputs: B

This function simply checks in which range the percentile pct falls into, and assigns a grade accordingly. The ranges were determined based on your requirements (20% B, 3% A+, 10% fail, etc.). If you want to adjust the grades, simply change the ranges.

  } else if (pct <= 0.95) {
    grade = "D-";
  } else {
    grade = "F";
  }
  return grade;
}

This revised version now includes D+ and D- by making the criteria for A through C grades stricter. The precise breakpoints between grades can be adjusted as needed.

User
I have this page:


@app.route('/final', methods=['GET'])
def final_page():
# Ensure there is a valid session

user_id = session.get('id')
if not user_id:
return redirect(url_for('home'))


return render_template("final.html")

Make it take the user_id as an argument of /final/user_id instaed

Assistant
Sure, you can modify the route to take user_id as a URL parameter. Here is an example:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
@app.route('/final/<user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def final_page(user_id):
    # Here, user_id is taken from the URL.
    # Ensure there is a valid session                                                                                                                 
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    return render_template("final.html")

Now, if you visit "/final/123", Flask will run the final_page function with "123" as the argument to user_id.


Please make sure to validate the user_id inside your function before using it to prevent unauthorized access.

User
How do I adjust this now return redirect(url_for('final_page'))

Assistant
To adjust this to pass a user_id, you can use the following:

1
return redirect(url_for('final_page', user_id=user_id))

Here, url_for generates the URL for the final_page function, and passes the user_id as an argument, which becomes a part of the generated URL. So, if user_id was 123, this would generate a URL like /final/123.

User
I want to share a link with people. I put : {{url_for('final_page', user_id=session['id'])}}. but this just has /final. I want the full domain name thing

Assistant
In Flask, url_for() function generates a relative URL. To get an absolute URL including the domain name, you need to set the _external parameter to True.

1
{{ url_for('final_page', user_id=session['id'], _external=True) }}

This will generate an absolute URL, which includes the protocol and hostname.


Please note that this will work correctly if your application is aware of its location. If you're running on localhost or if you're behind a proxy server, you might not get the expected results. In that case, you need to ensure Flask knows the correct server name and protocol.


You can set these in your Flask app configuration, for example:

1
2

Given a probability [0,1] and a temperature t write a function that logit-scales the prob, then multiples by t, then sigmoid's it, with numpy

Assistant
In Python with Numpy, you can use the following function:

 3

 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
import numpy as np

def adjust_prob(prob, temperature):
    # Compute logit (inverse of sigmoid)
    logit = np.log(prob / (1 - prob))

    # Multiply by temperature
    logit_temp = logit * temperature

    # Apply sigmoid to the result
    adjusted_prob = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-logit_temp))

    return adjusted_prob

Here's how this function works:




The np.log(prob / (1 - prob)) line computes the logit of the probability. The logit function is the inverse of the sigmoid function, and transforms probabilities from the range (0, 1) to any real number.




The logit * temperature line scales the logit value by the temperature. Higher temperature values will make the output probabilities closer to 0.5 (more uncertain), and lower temperatures will make the output probabilities closer to 0 or 1 (more confident).




The 1 / (1 + np.exp(-logit_temp)) line applies the sigmoid function to the scaled logit value, transforming it back to a probability in the range (0, 1).




Please note that this function assumes that the input prob is a valid probability in the range (0, 1), and doesn't have any special handling for values at the extremes of this range. For example, a prob value of exactly 1 would cause a divide-by-zero error due to the computation of the logit. You may want to add error checking or handling code if your use case might involve probabilities at the extreme ends of the range.

Can you make a html5 slider have text written beneath it with "Never" "Probably not" "I think so" and "Certainly"

<div class="slider">
    <input type="range" min="1" max="4" value="2" class="slider-input" id="probabilitySlider">
    <div class="slider-labels">
        <label>Never</label>
        <label>Probably not</label>
        <label>I think so</label>
        <label>Certainly</label>
    </div>
</div>

.slider {
    width: 100%;
}

.slider-input {
    width: 100%;
}

.slider-labels {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 10px 0;
}

In this code:




The input element with type "range" is the slider. The min and max attributes set the range of the slider to 1-4, and the value attribute sets the initial position of the slider.




The div with class "slider-labels" contains the labels for the slider. The labels are spaced out evenly across the width of the slider using CSS flexbox.




The CSS rules style the slider and position the labels. The "width: 100%;" rules make the slider and its labels stretch to fill the width of their container. The "display: flex;" and "justify-content: space-between;" rules make the labels sit in a row and spread out evenly across the width of the slider. The "padding: 10px 0;" rule adds some space above and below the labels.




You can adjust the CSS to fit your needs, for example by changing the font sizes or colors of the labels, or the size of the slider.

User
Can you make some overflow: auto thing with a max-height and make it auto-scroll to the bottom?

Assistant
Yes, you can create a scrollable container that automatically scrolls to the bottom by setting the overflow CSS property to auto and setting a max-height. Here is how you can do it:

1
2
3
<div id="scrollableContainer" style="max-height: 300px; overflow: auto;">
    <!-- Your content here -->
</div>

And here is the JavaScript code to make it scroll to the bottom:

1
2
var container = document.getElementById('scrollableContainer');
container.scrollTop = container.scrollHeight;

In this code:




max-height: 300px sets the maximum height of the container to 300 pixels. You can change this to any value you like.




overflow: auto makes the container scrollable if the content exceeds the max-height.




scrollTop is a property that gets or sets the number of pixels that the content of an element is scrolled upward.




scrollHeight is a read-only property that returns the height of an element in pixels, including padding, but not the border, scrollbar or margin.




When scrollTop is set to scrollHeight, it means the scrollbar is at the bottom of the container, thus it scrolls the container to the bottom.


You need to ensure that the JavaScript code runs after the content is loaded in the container, so you might need to call it in a function that is triggered when the content changes, or use it in a window.onload or $(document).ready() function if you are using jQuery.

Can you create a vertical line separating two divs using this
.question-answer {
display: flex;
justify-content: space-between;
margin-bottom: 20px;
}
.question-answer div {
width: 50%;
text-align: center;
}

Yes, you can add a vertical line between two divs by using the CSS border property. You would apply a right border to the first div, which would appear as a vertical line separating the two divs. Here is how you can do it:

    text-align: center;
}

/* Add a right border to the first div */
.question-answer div:first-child {
    border-right: 1px solid black; /* change color as needed */
    padding-right: 10px; /* optional, to give some space between the line and the text */
}

/* Add some padding to the second div to match the first one */
.question-answer div:last-child {
    padding-left: 10px; /* optional, to give some space between the line and the text */
}

In this code:




div:first-child selects the first div in .question-answer.




border-right: 1px solid black; applies a right border to the first div. You can change the color and thickness as needed.




padding-right: 10px; and padding-left: 10px; are optional, they provide some space between the text and the vertical line, which might make it look better. You can adjust the values as needed.




div:last-child selects the last div in .question-answer. We add a padding-left to this div to match the padding-right we added to the first div. This keeps the text in both divs evenly spaced from the vertical line.



User
Can you make the border start 25% down so the top 25% is blank?

Assistant
Making the border start 25% down from the top using only CSS can be a bit tricky, as borders normally span the full length of an element. However, there is a workaround using a pseudo-element ::after:

.question-answer {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    position: relative;  /* this is needed for positioning the ::after pseudo-element */
}

.question-answer div {
    width: 50%;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Create a pseudo-element for the vertical line */
.question-answer div:first-child::after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 25%;  /* Start the line 25% down from the top */
    bottom: 0;
    left: 50%;  /* Place the line in the middle */
    border-right: 1px solid black;  /* The line */
}

/* Add some padding to both divs */
.question-answer div:first-child {
    padding-right: 10px; 
}

.question-answer div:last-child {
    padding-left: 10px;
}

In this code:




The ::after pseudo-element creates a "fake" element after the content of the first div. We're using this fake element to draw the vertical line.




content: ""; is necessary for the pseudo-element to show up. If you don't include this, the pseudo-element won't appear.




position: absolute; takes the pseudo-element out of the normal document flow, and lets us position it anywhere we want within the .question-answer div.




top: 25%;, bottom: 0;, and left: 50%; position the pseudo-element. The line starts 25% down from the top, stretches to the bottom of the div, and is placed in the middle horizontally.




border-right: 1px solid black; is the line. You can change the color and thickness as needed.



User
Sorry I meant 25% down from where it would normally bea

Assistant
Ah, I see what you're saying. You want the border to start a quarter of the way down the div. We can use a linear-gradient background for this. Here's how you could do it:

.question-answer {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.question-answer div {
    width: 50%;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Add the vertical border */
.question-answer::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    width: 2px;
    height: 75%; /* Adjust this to change where the border starts */
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, transparent 25%, black 25%, black 100%);
    top: 12.5%;
    left: 50%;
}

In this code, we're using the ::after pseudo-element to add a border between the divs. We're using a linear-gradient as the background of the pseudo-element to make the border start part of the way down the div.


The linear-gradient goes from transparent at the top (0%) to black at the bottom (100%). The transition from transparent to black starts 25% of the way down the pseudo-element, which means the border starts 25% of the way down the div.


The height: 75%; and top: 12.5%; styles ensure that the border starts 25% of the way down the div and ends at the bottom of the div.


The width of the border is determined by width: 2px;, so you can adjust this as needed.

User
Can you optimize the following code with numpy:


from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
other_log_losses = [log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for score in other_scores]

Assistant
sklearn.metrics.log_loss calculates the log loss for the entire array, so it's more efficient to pass in all of your predictions at once, rather than looping over each prediction.


Here is how you can do it using numpy:

1
2
3
4
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss

other_log_losses = log_loss(np.full(len(other_scores), answers[qid]), other_scores, labels=[0, 1])

In the code above, np.full(len(other_scores), answers[qid]) creates an array of length len(other_scores) filled with answers[qid]. Then, log_loss is calculated for the entire array of actual and predicted values. Note that this will return the mean log loss over the entire array, instead of an array of log loss values.


However, please be aware that the log_loss function from sklearn expects its inputs in the form of probabilities. If other_scores is not in the form of probabilities, you would need to convert it first.


Please also keep in mind that this change will affect any code that expects other_log_losses to be a list of log loss values.

User
I want it to be a vector of losses on each element

Assistant
I see, you want a vector of individual log losses for each score in other_scores.


sklearn.metrics.log_loss is designed to calculate the average log loss for a set of predictions, and doesn't directly support calculating individual log losses. However, we can get around this by using the formula for log loss directly with numpy.


Here's how you can do it:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
import numpy as np

def individual_log_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred = np.clip(y_pred, 1e-15, 1 - 1e-15)  # Clip values for numerical stability
    return -(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))

other_log_losses = individual_log_loss(answers[qid], np.array(other_scores))

In this code, individual_log_loss calculates the log loss for each prediction using the formula for log loss. This gives a list of log loss values, one for each prediction. We then use np.array() to convert other_scores into a numpy array before passing it to individual_log_loss.


Keep in mind that this will return the negative log loss for each prediction, which is typically what we're interested in when talking about "log loss" (since lower values are better). If you want the positive log loss, you can simply remove the - sign from the formula.

User
Can you also make this much faster:


def adjust_prob(prob, temperature):
# Compute logit (inverse of sigmoid)

logit = np.log(prob / (1 - prob))


# Multiply by temperature                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
logit_temp = logit * temperature

# Apply sigmoid to the result                                                                                                                                                                                                                
adjusted_prob = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-logit_temp))

return adjusted_prob


user_log_losses = np.mean([log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for qid, score in user_entries.items()])
all_log_losses = [np.mean([log_loss([answers[qid]], [score], labels=[0, 1]) for qid, score in user_entries.items()]) for user_entries in all_entries.values()]

steps = (10**np.arange(-2, 2, .01)).tolist()
ls = []
for temperature in steps:
    ls.append(np.mean([log_loss([answers[qid]], [adjust_prob(score, temperature)], labels=[0, 1]) for qid, score in user_entries.items()]))
Assistant
The function adjust_prob can operate on numpy arrays without any modification, so you can get a speedup by passing arrays of probabilities and temperatures to it instead of individual numbers.


Here's how you can rewrite your code to take advantage of this:

def vectorized_log_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred = np.clip(y_pred, 1e-15, 1 - 1e-15)  # Clip values for numerical stability
    return -(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))

def adjust_prob(prob, temperature):
    # Compute logit (inverse of sigmoid)
    logit = np.log(prob / (1 - prob))

    # Multiply by temperature
    logit_temp = logit * temperature

    # Apply sigmoid to the result
    adjusted_prob = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-logit_temp))

    return adjusted_prob

answers_array = np.array(list(answers.values()))
user_entries_array = np.array(list(user_entries.values()))

user_log_losses = np.mean(vectorized_log_loss(answers_array, user_entries_array))
all_log_losses = np.array([np.mean(vectorized_log_loss(answers_array, np.array(list(user_entries.values())))) for user_entries in all_entries.values()])

steps = (10**np.arange(-2, 2, .01)).tolist()

temperatures = np.array(steps)
adjusted_probs = adjust_prob(user_entries_array[:, None], temperatures)

ls = np.mean(vectorized_log_loss(answers_array[:, None], adjusted_probs), axis=0)

In this code, adjust_prob and vectorized_log_loss are both applied to entire arrays of probabilities/temperatures at once, and np.mean is used to calculate the mean log loss over the adjusted probabilities. This should give you a significant speedup compared to the previous version.

User
user_entries_array = np.array(list(user_entries.values()))


does not work because in user_entries the user might not have answered all the questions. For the ones they skipped initially fill in their guess with .5

Assistant
In that case, you could first initialize an array filled with 0.5 and then fill in the answers that the user did provide. Here's how you can do that:

1
2
3
user_entries_array = np.full(len(answers), 0.5)
for qid, score in user_entries.items():
    user_entries_array[qid] = score

This will create an array where the i-th entry corresponds to the score for the i-th question. If the user did not provide an answer to a question, the score will remain at the default value of 0.5.


Please make sure qid is an integer representing the question's position in the answers list. If it's a string or some other type of identifier, you'll need to establish a mapping from qid to index.

User
Also fix all_log_losses = np.array([np.mean(vectorized_log_loss(answers_array, np.array(list(user_entries.values())))) for user_entries in all_entries.values()])

Assistant
The same principle applies here for handling missing answers. For each user in all_entries, create an array with a default guess of 0.5 and then fill in their actual answers. Here's how you can adjust the all_log_losses calculation:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
all_log_losses = []
for user_entries in all_entries.values():
    user_entries_array = np.full(len(answers), 0.5)
    for qid, score in user_entries.items():
        user_entries_array[qid] = score
    all_log_losses.append(np.mean(vectorized_log_loss(answers_array, user_entries_array)))
all_log_losses = np.array(all_log_losses)

Remember to ensure the correct mapping from qid to index, as I mentioned earlier.

User
I have a list of [xs, ys]. Given some target x, estimate the integral from xs.min() to x

Assistant
Given a list of points defined by two lists xs and ys (where xs are the x-coordinates and ys are the corresponding y-coordinates of the points), you can estimate the integral from xs.min() to some target x using numerical integration methods.


If you assume that the points in xs and ys describe a curve, you can use the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration which can be implemented in numpy using numpy.trapz. The trapezoidal rule approximates the definite integral by summing up the areas of the trapezoids formed by the line segments along the curve.


Here's a Python function that does that:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
import numpy as np

def estimate_integral(xs, ys, target_x):
    assert len(xs) == len(ys), "xs and ys must have the same length"
    assert np.min(xs) <= target_x <= np.max(xs), "target_x must be within the range of xs"

    # Find the index of the largest x that is smaller or equal to target_x
    target_index = np.max(np.where(xs <= target_x))

    # Estimate the integral using the trapezoidal rule
    integral_value = np.trapz(ys[:target_index + 1], xs[:target_index + 1])

    return integral_value

This function returns an estimate of the integral of the curve described by xs and ys from xs.min() to target_x. Note that this approach assumes that the points in xs and ys are sorted in ascending order by xs. If they aren't, you would need to sort them first.


This function uses the numpy's trapz function, which approximates the definite integral by the trapezoidal rule. The precision of this method depends on the number of points and their distribution. If the points are closely spaced and evenly distributed, the estimate will be more accurate. If the points are sparse or unevenly distributed, the estimate may be less accurate.


Also note that if target_x is not exactly one of the xs, this function uses the largest x that is smaller or equal to target_x to calculate the integral. If you want a more precise result, you would need to interpolate the ys value at target_x, which can be done with numpy.interp or scipy's interpolation functions. However, that would complicate the code a bit.

User
In flask jsonify how do I make it print floats to just 3 digits of precision

Assistant
In Flask, you can customize JSON encoding by extending the flask.json.JSONEncoder class. You would then override its default method to specify the format for float numbers.

    def iter_encode(self, o, _one_shot=False):
        if isinstance(o, float):
            yield format(o, '.3f')
        elif isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):
            yield format(o, '.3f')
        else:
            if _one_shot and c_make_encoder is not None:
                _iterencode = c_make_encoder(
                    markers, self.default, _encoder, self.indent,
                    self.key_separator, self.item_separator, self.sort_keys,
                    self.skipkeys, _one_shot)
            else:
                _iterencode = _make_iterencode(
                    markers, self.default, _encoder, self.indent,
                    self.key_separator, self.item_separator, self.sort_keys,
                    self.skipkeys, _one_shot)
            yield from _iterencode(o, 0)

app.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder

Now, any response from Flask's jsonify will use this custom encoder, and all float numbers will be represented with 3 decimal places. Please note that this will globally affect all the JSON responses from your Flask application.


If you want to apply this precision only to specific responses, you might want to manually format those specific float numbers to strings with desired precision in the respective view functions, before passing them to jsonify().
